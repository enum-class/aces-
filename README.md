# c-aces

## Overview
c-aces is a C implementation of [ACES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13255.pdf) (Arithmetic Channel Encryption Scheme), a novel cryptosystem constructed using category theory, specifically leveraging the Yoneda Lemma. ACES eliminates the need for bootstrapping techniques, offering a more efficient and secure Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme.

This repository provides a practical and efficient implementation of ACES in C, enabling experimentation and integration into various systems requiring secure computations.
It serves as an educational and experimental endeavor for exploring the implementation of ACES.

Please note that a Python implementation of ACES is already available, For additional documentation please refer to the [original Python implementation repository](https://github.com/remytuyeras/aces). You can find extensive documentation and resources there to aid in understanding and using ACES.
